WELCOME TO MY BLOG üôè

Let's have a quick introduction :)
My name is ROHIT RAJ, Currently pursuing my B tech. degree from Asansol Engineering College.
I have done my Intermediate from T.Y.K.S college Sitamarhi and Matriculation from Sacred Heart School Sitamarhi.
And Currently working as a Software Developer @InvescaTechnology.
Now coming to my blog! ‚úçÔ∏è
I'm here to put my thoughts about the programmers...
Actually I'm writting this blog after a question asked by my younger brother that "Bhaiya I think being a Software Developer is a quite genuius
and extraordinary because the digital magic we all are experience around us is something like MAGIC, isn't it?"
Hence I replied to him that this one is the most important myth to dispel, the myth of the privileged mind.
There is no special thing your brain must have to be able to become a programmer. Programming is a skill like playing the guitar or running a marathon.
You get better at it by doing it, by dedicating time and effort and By learning from others.
It's a skill that you develop and grow the more you do and the more productive effort you put into it.
If you see a programmer who is capable of doing amazing stuff with a computer, it is always the result of dedicating time and energy into their craft.
It's not some innate talent they were born with or some divine inspiration.
Now Coming to his 2nd question that was...
What Does a Computer Programmer Do?


The Basics
Computer programmers write code for programs that will be on computers.
The process starts with software engineers designing a program, and then the programmers turn it into
something the computer can read. From there, the program can move onto the next stage in the process of creation.
Programmers may be asked to reprogram several times after continued iterations.
in-Defth Look
Programmers are either applications programmers or systems programmers.
Systems programmers create operational software and will sometimes look at their systems to make sure they are compatible with other operational software.
Applications programmers might upgrade, create, or customize certain software programs to fit within a certain context.
